# Personal Dotfiles
Dotfiles for Mac OSX and (previously) Debian Jessie.

Items in my OSX setup:

* [**chunkwm**](https://github.com/koekeishiya/chunkwm): tiling windows manager
* [**skhd**](https://github.com/koekeishiya/skhd): hotkey daemon
* **vim**: modal text editor

## Installation
I use [`stow`](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) to manage my dotfiles.

### macOS/OSX
There a laundry list of things to do on a fresh install of OSX/MacOS:
