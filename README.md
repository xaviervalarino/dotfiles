# Personal Dotfiles
I use these dotfiles on Mac OSX and Debian Jessie.

## Bash
Some color, a lot of bash aliases, along with some OS specific settings

## Vim
I have been slowly learning Vim, mostly because I hate switching windows between the terminal and my text editor.

## Sublime
That being said, Sublime still remains my editor of choice when I need to get something done.
I am currently using [SyntaxMgr](https://github.com/randy3k/SyntaxMgr) to manage platform specific settings.

## Nano
I find myself using this editor from time to time...
