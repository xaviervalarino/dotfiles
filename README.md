# Personal Dotfiles
Dotfiles for Mac OSX and (previously) Debian Jessie.

Items in my OSX setup:

* [**chunkwm**](https://github.com/koekeishiya/chunkwm): tiling windows manager
* [**skhd**](https://github.com/koekeishiya/skhd): hotkey daemon
* **vim**: modal text editor

## Installing
I use [`stow`](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) to manage my dotfiles. If you're not familiar with it, I suggest you do. It makes symlinking the config files from this repo straightforward and easy.

Note: Some applications should be run first to create the config directories before running `stow`. This will keep stow from symlinking the whole directory and picking up unwanted files generated by the program (_e.g._, Vim, Sublime Text)

### VIM
**TODO**: add cURL for Vim plugin installation

Create `.vim` dir before running stow
Create `.vim/undo` dir

```
mkdir ~/.vim
```

### macOS/OSX
There a laundry list of things to do on a fresh install of OSX/MacOS:
