# Personal Dotfiles
Dotfiles for Mac OSX and Debian Jessie.

## Bash
Configuration includes color for PS1, bash aliases, and OS specific settings (controlled by looking up `uname`)

### Installation
Running the setup script will [symlink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_link) all the files located in bash/ to the home directory.
```bash
# from inside dotfiles directory
./config/bash_setup.sh # run script
```

## [Terminator](http://gnometerminator.blogspot.com/p/introduction.html)
A terminal emulator with some nice features like window splitting and dropping files to get the path

### Installation
Sets up the terminal with no scrollbar and the base16-ocean dark colorscheme
```bash
# from inside dotfiles directory
./config/terminator_setup.sh # run script
```
-->
## Vim
I have been slowly learning Vim. This was born from the desire to be able do everything in the terminalâ€”jumping back and forth between the terminal and a text editor window while debugging starts to feel tedious.

### Installation
Running the setup script will symlink _vimrc_ to your home directory, installs [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) (if it is not already installed) and installs or updates plugins
```bash
# from inside dotfiles directory
./config/vim_setup.sh # run script
```
