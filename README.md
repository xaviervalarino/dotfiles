# Personal Dotfiles
I use these dotfiles on Mac OSX and Debian Jessie.

## Bash
Some color, a lot of bash aliases, along with some OS specific settings

###Installation
Running the setup script will [symlink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_link) all the bash files to the home directory.
```bash
chmod +x config/bash_setup.sh # make script executable
./config/bash_setup.sh        # run script
```

## Vim
I have been slowly learning Vim. This was born from the desire to be able do everything in the terminalâ€”jumping back and forth between the terminal and a text editor window while debugging starts to feel tedious.

###Installation
Running the setup script will symlink _vimrc_ to your home directory, installs [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) (if it is not already installed) and installs or updates plugins
```bash
chmod +x config/vim_setup.sh # make script executable
./config/vim_setup.sh        # run script
```

## Sublime
That being said, Sublime still remains my editor of choice when I need to get something done quickly.

## Nano
I find myself using this editor from time to time... so why not have syntax highlighting on all of my machines?

## [Conky](https://github.com/brndnmtthws/conky)
I use conky to monitor:
* Network connection
* CPU load
* Memory usage
* Disk Space
