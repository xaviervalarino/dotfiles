# Personal Dotfiles
I use these dotfiles on Mac OSX and Debian Jessie.

## Bash
Some color, a lot of bash aliases, along with some OS specific settings

## Vim
I have been slowly learning Vim. This was born from the desire to be able do everything in the terminal--It can become tedious to jump back and form between the terminal and a text editor window when trying to debug a NodeJS call stack.

## Sublime
That being said, Sublime still remains my editor of choice when I need to get something done quickly.

I am currently using [SyntaxMgr](https://github.com/randy3k/SyntaxMgr) to manage platform specific settings.

## Nano
I find myself using this editor from time to time... and who doesn't like syntax highlighting.

## Conky
My conky config needs more information and a screenshot.
